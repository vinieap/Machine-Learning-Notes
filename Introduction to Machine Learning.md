# Types of Machine Learning
---
There are three main types of machine learning:

1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where the correct output is provided. The goal is to learn the relationship between the input features and the output labels.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset, where the correct output is not provided. The goal is to discover underlying patterns or structures in the data.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

## Common Machine Learning Algorithms

Here are some common machine learning algorithms:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Neural Networks
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- K-Means Clustering
- Deep Learning

## Popular Machine Learning Libraries

Below are some popular machine learning libraries in Python:

- Scikit-learn: A library for general-purpose machine learning tasks, such as classification, regression, and clustering.
- TensorFlow: A library for numerical computation and machine learning, particularly focused on deep learning.
- Keras: A high-level neural networks library that works with TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK as its backends.
- PyTorch: A deep learning library that supports dynamic computation graphs and is popular for natural language processing and computer vision tasks.

## Machine Learning Workflow

A typical machine learning workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather the dataset required for your machine learning problem.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, preprocess, and prepare the data for your machine learning algorithm.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Select or create relevant features for your model.
4. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for your problem.
5. **Model Training**: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model on a validation or test set.
7. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model to make predictions or decisions in real-world applications.
